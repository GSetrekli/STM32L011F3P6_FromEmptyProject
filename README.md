STM32L011F3P6 is programmed with ST-link in register level programming over STM32 cube IDE without being any discovery board.
The image in the repository the SOP20 package represents the STM32FL011. For capacitors value  and for more details about connection  **the power supply scheme** ,for example VDD,VSS connection, refer to you must datasheet , for **the boot configuration** refer to AN4467. For another benefit documents I suggested for coding you can look at my other repository from empty project.
